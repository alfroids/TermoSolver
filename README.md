# TermoSolver
An entropy-based [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)-like game solver. Capable of solving games in parallel, such as the ones in [Termo](https://term.ooo/). Inspire by [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA).

External packages used: `numpy`, `unidecode` and `tqdm` (optional).

Use the command `python termo.py -h` to get help on how to use the script.
